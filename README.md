This repository contains all weekly tasks.

Unfortunately due to the time constrains this repository was not updated weekly :( BUT all of the files should be there :) Found these tasks very challenging due to the nature of the subject

There are 8 different programs in this repository

1. bmi.py           => Program that calculates somebody's Body Mass Index (BMI)
                        The inputs are the person's height in centimetres and weight in kilograms
                        The output is their BMI

2. secondstring.py  => Program that asks a user to 
                        input a string and 
                        outputs every second letter in reverse order

3. collatz.py       => Program that asks the user to 
                        input any positive integer and 
                        outputs the successive values of the following calculation.
                            At each step it calculates the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one.

4. weekday.py       => Program that outputs whether or not today is a weekday

5. scrt.py          => Program that takes a positive floating-point number as input and 
                        outputs an approximation of its square root. Despite the request of trying not to use the available formula, unfortunately i did, as after spending considerable amount of time, i simply gave up :)

6. es.py            => Program that reads in a text file and outputs the number of e's it contains. 
                        The program takes the filename from an argument on the command line.

7. plottask.py      => Program that displays a plot of the functions f(x)=x, g(x)=x2 and h(x)=x3 in 
                        the range [0, 4] on the one set of axes.
